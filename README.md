# Reactive_LEDs
A project to prototype various physical interactive input methods and how to use their results to control various elements of LED Pixel Tape


## What does this need to do?

- Define colours

- Take reading from proximity sensor and return value

- Use formula to translate this reading into integer that can be applied to Pixel commands

- Interpret sensor readings to activate pixels (closer proximity, more pixels lit) AND/OR interpret sensor readings to alter brightness of pixels (closer proximity, brighter pixels)


### Sensor Pins

- Echo - GP2
- Trig - GP3


### LED Pins

- VCC Pin 40
- GND - GND
- Data - GP28
